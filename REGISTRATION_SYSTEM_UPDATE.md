# Registration System Update

## Overview
The registration system has been updated to provide completely separate, independent registration pages for clients and plumbers. Each page is a standalone experience with no cross-navigation or tabs.

## New Structure

### 1. Main Registration Page (`/register`)
- **Route**: `GET /register`
- **Controller**: `RegisterController@show`
- **View**: `resources/views/auth/register.blade.php`
- **Purpose**: Original combined registration form (kept for backward compatibility)

### 2. Client Registration (`/client/register`)
- **Route**: `GET /client/register` and `POST /client/register`
- **Controller**: `ClientRegistrationController`
- **View**: `resources/views/auth/client-register.blade.php`
- **Features**:
  - Simplified form focused on client needs
  - Company name is optional
  - No VAT number requirement
  - Redirects to client dashboard after registration

### 3. Plumber Registration (`/plumber/register`)
- **Route**: `GET /plumber/register` and `POST /plumber/register`
- **Controller**: `PlumberRegistrationController`
- **View**: `resources/views/auth/plumber-register.blade.php`
- **Features**:
  - Company name is required
  - VAT number field included
  - Business-focused messaging
  - Redirects to plumber dashboard after registration

## Key Differences

### Client Registration
- **Company Name**: Optional
- **VAT Number**: Not included
- **Messaging**: Focused on finding plumbers
- **Validation**: Basic user information required

### Plumber Registration
- **Company Name**: Required
- **VAT Number**: Included (for invoicing)
- **Messaging**: Focused on business growth
- **Validation**: Business information required

## Files Created/Modified

### New Controllers
- `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/ClientRegistrationController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/PlumberRegistrationController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegistrationChoiceController.php`

### New Views
- `resources/views/auth/register-choice.blade.php`
- `resources/views/auth/client-register.blade.php`
- `resources/views/auth/plumber-register.blade.php`

### Modified Files
- `routes/web.php` - Added new registration routes
- `resources/views/welcome.blade.php` - Updated registration links

## Routes

```php
// Main registration (combined form - backward compatibility)
Route::get('/register', [RegisterController::class, 'show'])->name('register');
Route::post('/register', [RegisterController::class, 'store'])->name('register.store');

// Client registration (standalone page)
Route::get('/client/register', [ClientRegistrationController::class, 'create'])->name('client.register');
Route::post('/client/register', [ClientRegistrationController::class, 'store'])->name('client.register.store');

// Plumber registration (standalone page)
Route::get('/plumber/register', [PlumberRegistrationController::class, 'create'])->name('plumber.register');
Route::post('/plumber/register', [PlumberRegistrationController::class, 'store'])->name('plumber.register.store');
```

## User Flow

1. **User chooses registration type**
   - **Direct access**: User goes directly to `/client/register` or `/plumber/register`
   - **From welcome page**: User clicks "Register as Client" or "Register as Plumber"
   - **From main register**: User can use the original combined form at `/register`

2. **Each page is completely independent**
   - No navigation between registration types
   - No tabs or role selection
   - Each page is a standalone experience

3. **User fills out role-specific form**
   - Form validation matches role requirements
   - Address search functionality included
   - WhatsApp number required for both

4. **Registration completion**
   - User is logged in automatically
   - Welcome notifications sent (email + WhatsApp)
   - Redirected to appropriate dashboard

## Benefits

1. **Complete Separation**: Each registration type has its own dedicated page
2. **No Confusion**: Users go directly to the right registration form
3. **Better UX**: No tabs, no navigation between types
4. **Data Quality**: Required fields match business needs
5. **Maintainability**: Separate controllers for easier updates
6. **Scalability**: Easy to add new user types in the future

## Testing

To test the new system:

1. Visit `/client/register` - Should show client registration form
2. Visit `/plumber/register` - Should show plumber registration form
3. Visit `/register` - Should show original combined registration form
4. Test form submission for all three types
5. Verify redirects to appropriate dashboards

## Future Enhancements

- Add role-specific onboarding flows
- Include service area selection for plumbers
- Add business verification for plumbers
- Include service category selection
- Add profile completion wizards
